## Ryan's Advent of Code 2020 Repo ðŸŽ„ðŸŒŸ

This year, I'm trying out **Python 3.9**, which is the latest version at time of writing.

I had debated choosing a different language.  TypeScript, C/C++, C# and Rust were all on the table.  I was close to picking either TS or C.

### Goal ðŸ¥…

I figured it was better to check out some of the newer features of Python 3 (if possible).  A lot of these puzzles I'll try to be focused on "cranking it out."  As such, certain aspects will get more attention than others.  For example, if a puzzle is taking a long, long time to process, the priority may be **speed**.  If I'm quickly trying to solve a problem, the priority may be **speed** writing.

It will be an interesting time to explore optimizations, suggestions, third-party modules and functions I have been unfamiliar with.  And in conclusion, my goals are to:

- Learn by discovery & from others
- Have fun
- Complete more puzzles than ever (aka  less procrastination! ðŸ˜œ)
